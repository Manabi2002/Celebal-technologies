 I worked on building an automated pipeline using Azure Data Factory. 
The project involved fetching country and product data from a REST API and storing it in Azure Data Lake in JSON format.
Tools used (Azure Data Factory, REST API, ADLS) 
What you did (built, automated, scheduled, triggered pipeline) 
Impact (saved time, improved efficiency, reduced manual work)
 Key features:
* Connects to multiple data sources (APIs, databases, cloud storage, etc.)
* Automates workflows (called pipelines)
* Handles big data movement and transformations
* Supports scheduling (e.g., run every day at 12 AM)
